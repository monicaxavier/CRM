The CRM market is flooded with many applications. We want to aim to do our best in this. The rise of
SaaS has turned software industry into a booming business. There are many issues within SaaS.
However -- the industry is not like manufacturing or airline industry.

There is no perfect software, yet we want software to be flexible to meet the needs of many.

User problems of Software:
Too complex
Too many features
Unintuitive
Bugs
Takes too long to wait
Many screens, When we are shifting to many tabs in browsing, our attention loses from
the content.

Computer Science problems of Software:
Scaling the software
Response rate, optimization
Complexity

When I was in Orlando, Florida. I got 50 emails a day. I could not manage them. I felt
frustrated, anxious and wanted to burn my email box. I even deleted all emails sent from
CRU. I just did not know how to?

But I knew who would hold the solution for it. It was the President of Cru's assistant.
I met him for coffee. I badly wanted to learn his skill. He didn't know me but I was comfortable
meeting new people and becoming friends every-day. I showed him my problem. My email box was flooded,
I wanted to yell and scream at CRU for sending me automation emails. He showed how he labeled the President's email.

In three months, I learnt that skill and I felt extremely happy. I thanked him so much.

The Software is there but I did not know how to use it efficiently? It took few months to learn basics of
organizing an email.

Question: Customer Relationship Management means?
Answer: Kallamozhi -> You own a store, Grocery StoreQuestion: Customer Relationship Management means?
 Kallamozhi -> You own a store, Grocery Store.Everyday you have 10 customers.
 Raja, Muthuvel, Nambi, Kumar. ..... 10. .
 Diwali Season, Kallamozhi, you have a festival. 1000 people,
 1000 people are visiting your store.
 YOu want to maintain Relationship, Service, data, contacts...
 1 Person can handle 4 people. But a Software can handle 1000 people's contact.
 The Store owner asks to enter what thy want in a software. Everyone owns a cell-phone and internet.
 The Store owner can send details, coupons, to his 1000 people with a click of software.
 We cannot create one software for everything. Gmail is a product -- to communicate.
 Gmail cannot become CRM.

 Muthu opened his email.


 Security -> What is the problem? Phishing -- How to solve it?
 API + Cryptography + Security Analytics = Software product.


Bill_GATES -> IBM -> OS/360 --> MANUAL or DOCUMENTATION.
We can do it better. Sofware would be a vision.
He built little bit in Windows 95, 98... Hired people.

Theme in Software Industry.
business to commercial industry - > Facebook, Google, Skype . People do not pay money.
business to business industry > Zoho, why? Because they sell their product to business only.
Hisory of Software --DOS -> Windows 95 -> Internet -> Web-browser -> Social Network -> Mobile Applications
SaaS model --> Sofware as a Service model. Use this software on cloud, cutomer support, monthly to yearly plan
API
