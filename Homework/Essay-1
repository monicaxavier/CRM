Rick --> I have not written many programs
Rick is following Bill Gates.
How did Bill Gates write Microsoft Windows?
He did not know from thin-air. He read documentation, other OS, and added hiw own thought.
Rick -> Python -> Libraries [Math,Graphics, GAmes, Security, API]
Moni -> How to teach to build software?
 			- history of software, busineses, programs, software. 
			- Python -> Library -> How Python founders or library, they wrote code.
			Python -> How Python was written? [Core][Libraries]->[Software]
			O.S -> Software ->[Core][Libraries]->

Sample Questions:

Rick: Why do I need to know about Data-Structure?
Rick: What is Programming Languages
Why do I need to know about it?
Rick: What can I know after knowing Data-structure?
Rick: What kind of Data-structure would Kodai-CRM need?
What did you understand from Programming languages wikipedia?
#Changes
What is Prolog?
What is the core problem of CRM?

To Answer This Question Let Us Understand First What Is Language in Common?
	Language is a tool to express our thoughts, to communicate with other people, to get help from others or to help others we need to
	//**The first point is correct, language is way to express our thoughts.
	interact with other people. So in the beginning there must be some sign language to communicate. Then the sign language could have
	evolved into speaking language. I think computer programming language also same like that only.
	//**Computer Programming language is precise, it is not ambigious, it has to be accurate. We use 010 to communicate in the micro-processor.
So What Is Computer?

	It is a machine like other machines (washing machine, Grinder, Fan, Fridge). what machines can do? it helps to reduce the manpower,
	//Okay, try defining machine here. Machine does help us to reduce work. Good point.

	to solve the real time problem, to reduce the complexity of the work.


	likewise, computer machine is reducing the complexity of the work.
	let’s take calculator, what calculator is doing? if there is small problem then it is easy to solve by our own. what if the problem is
	bigger? how can we add or subtract or multiply finance details for a mega company. shall we do everything manually? NO, because
	it will take so much of time to solve the problem.
	I am giving you an insight to understand the computer machine. computer machine has a multiple software or you can say programs,
	features, services to reduce the complexity of the work.
Why We Need to Interact with The Computer?
	As I said before to interact with the computer machine to do some work we need to communicate with the machine. Can machine
	understand our speaking language? No. So how to make the machine to understand our needs? here comes the programming languages.
	programming languages helps to interact with the machines and programming languages give instructions/orders to machine to do a work.
	Does machine understand programming language? yes partially! there will be compiler in each computer machine. This compiler will
	convert the 'PROGRAM' into ‘BINARY CODE' which is the machine understandable code.
Thousands of different programming languages have been created.
Example:
•	C
•	C++
•	JAVA
•	Python
•	PHP
//**Try defining data structure in your own words, please.
	Data structure is organizing the data, How the data is storing in the memory, managing the data, retrieving the data, how the data is
	related other data.
//**What do you mean by data values in the below?
	consider your date of birth or name or your address this is data value.

In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.
More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations
that can be applied to the data.
=======
Why do I need to know about Data-Structure?
	when working with data and application we need to know how the data is connected with the application, how the data is being
	stored,manipulated,how the data flows within the application i.e structure of data.
	For example assume there is a hospital management application. when new patients come their details will be stored in the database.
	once the data is stored the hospital can use it for multi-purpose.
	In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.
	More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations
	that can be applied to the data.

	 I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his
	 data structures more important." - Linus Torvalds

	 Data structures and algorithms are patterns for solving problems.You'll understand, in depth, how your computer gets things
	 done. This informs any technical decisions you make, regardless of whether or not you're using a given algorithm directly.
	 Everything from memory allocation in the depths of your operating system, to the inner workings of your RDBMS to how your
	 networking stack manages to send data from one corner of Earth to another. All computers rely on fundamental data structures
	 and algorithms, so understanding them better makes you understand the computer better.

	Thoughts on mail washer software
	This software helps to get rid of spams, phishing mails 
	when we get a mail we simply cant open the mail when it contains virus,phishing links. if we open it or click the link it may leads 
	to some serious data theft or it may affect your system.
	This software scans your mailbox and decides whether the mail contains any threats or a normal one. if the mail is spam or it contains
	any virus this software will automatically clean our mailbox without taking risk on own.
	why do people use it?
	SECURITY
	who will safegaurd your system when your mailbox seems vulnerable. This software will sacure your mailbox by scanni g the mail. lets say
	you are net banking on you system what if the unknown sender sends you a mail attached with data stealing plugin you will open the mail
	and data got stealed by someone.
	by using this software you can avoid all these things.
