what is data type?
It is way to classify the type of data (i.e integer, strings) which determines the values that can be used with the corresponding type of data.
  There are two types of data,
    -Built in data type
    -Derived Data type

Built in Data type
those data types for which a language has built in support are known as built in data types.
  -Integers
  -String
  -Float

Derived Data typeThose data types which are implementation independent as they can be implemented in one or the other way are known as derived
data types. These data types are normally built by the combination of primary or built-in data types and associated operations on them. For
example −

    List
    Array
    Stack
    Queue

Array
Array is a container which holds a fixed number of  items should be a same type. (ex : 1 litre water bottle is a container which holds 1 litre
of water )
elements
each items in an array is called an element.
index
each location of an element in an array has a numerical index which is used to identify the element.(the index starts with 0,1,2,3,...)

  int array[10] = { 10,20,55,33,66,44,21,56,76,78}
  here int is the type, array is the name if the array and [10] is the size of the array.
  here the index starts with 0 to 9.

 Basic operations supported with array
 TRAVERSE -  prints the element in the array one by one.
 INSERTION -  adds an element at the given index.
 DELETION - delete the element at the given index.
 SEARCH - search an element using the index or value.
 UPDATE - update the element at the given index.

 Let LA be a Linear Array (unordered) with N elements and K is a positive integer such that K<=N. Following is the algorithm where ITEM
 is inserted into the Kth position of LA −

1. Start
2. Set J = N
3. Set N = N+1
4. Repeat steps 5 and 6 while J >= K
5. Set LA[J+1] = LA[J]
6. Set J = J-1
7. Set LA[K] = ITEM
8. Stop
Example
Following is the implementation of the above algorithm −

 Live Demo
#include <stdio.h>

main() {
   int LA[] = {1,3,5,7,8};
   int item = 10, k = 3, n = 5;
   int i = 0, j = n;

   printf("The original array elements are :\n");

   for(i = 0; i<n; i++) {
      printf("LA[%d] = %d \n", i, LA[i]);
   }

   n = n + 1;

   while( j >= k) {
      LA[j+1] = LA[j];
      j = j - 1;
   }

   LA[k] = item;

   printf("The array elements after insertion :\n");

   for(i = 0; i<n; i++) {
      printf("LA[%d] = %d \n", i, LA[i]);
   }
}
When we compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result −

Output
The original array elements are :
LA[0] = 1
LA[1] = 3
LA[2] = 5
LA[3] = 7
LA[4] = 8
The array elements after insertion :
LA[0] = 1
LA[1] = 3
LA[2] = 5
LA[3] = 10
LA[4] = 7
LA[5] = 8
