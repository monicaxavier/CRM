What is Unix/Linux? Why it is needed?
 To understand this lets know about operating system first. What is operating system? Why does a computer need an operating system? 
 An operating system is the essential program which allows other programs to run and execute (music player, games, paint, word) without 
 operating system the hardware system cannot interact with the software i.e. computer machine cannot able to interact with the music player, 
 paint or word. Operating system is also a set of program.
What is UNIX?
 AT&T had developed a set of programs (operating system i.e. UNIX) which was used for developers purpose, to execute other programs. UNIX 
 is like a platform which can be able to do multi-tasking. So while typing some documents, one can able to listen to music this is 
 multi-tasking. UNIX has many descendant OS and we can group them into two categories. The first was BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) 
 an open-source Unix-like operating system. BSD lives on today through FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD. NeXTStep was also based on the original 
 BSD, Appleâ€™s Mac OS X was based on NeXTStep, and iOS was based on Mac OS X.
