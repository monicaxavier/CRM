User_requirements

System_requirements

Functional Requirements: How the system should interact and behave in different
situations. What the System is supposed to do.Eg: Functions of Toothbrush?
To Brush the Teeth.

Non-Functional Requirements: Constrains by the system.

This includes reliability, time, scalibility, peformance,
security. Sometimes, this is more important.Eg: What is Non-Functional
Requirement of Toothbrush? But Toothbrush breaks after you brush your teeth.
[Make sure we can quantitavely test out the Non-Functional Requirement]
[Ease of Use: Training Time, Number of Help Frames]

Product_Requirement: This CRM will be available to Church Members (Mon-Sunday)

Organizational_Requirement: Church members will be able to access this product.

Use Case:
Ethnography: Cultural and Systematic study. How the software product would be supposed
in a cultural and work context.
Requirement Validation: a) Consistency b) Validation c) Completeness d) Realism Check

System Modelling:

Kallamozhi:

MAthematics: Circle, Number,

Abstract: Men

John, Fioz, Muthu
Concrete: Real World existing

Documentation:
Verbalize the whole process

Benefits -- Concrete knowledge of Software
            Others can read your Software
            Easy maintainence

# IDEA: Abstract

1) Requirements, Idea formulate -- Proposal,
Requirements -- System Requirements, Design, Architectural,
Software [Prototype], Implementation, Testing, Review.

Suppose you built a Church CRM.
Features -- Calender, SMS messaging, Contacts.
Okay you built it.
They want more features. But if you add more features, calnder won't work.
Will you redo all the code? Nope. Will you write 10,000 lines of code again?
Suppose afte you build a Church CRM. RMKV likes your product. Will you write 10,000
lines of code and create seperate product or you will reuse the code to make them also use
same product?

Always plan long-term, multiple industries, best practices within Software industry.
Reuse! maintainence.
In house there are windows.. different models. They'll just change.

Rick goes to A1-Parotta Stall. Rick orders Chilli Chicken and parrota.
Billing -> Abraham, He will give it to Master Parotta. He will have basic ingedients
for Chilli Chicken. Next, Muth goes to A-1 Parotta Stal. He asks for Butter Chicken.
Will Parotta Master have different ingredients for Butter Chicken or he would reuse the same receipie?

KODAI CRM -- Requirement
            -- Kodai CRM System Model -- interact, behave,
System Modeling: [Explain 5][If you cannot put into your own words, you have not understood]
[Book-reading][Try to formulate it into your own words]
[Write it][Try][When you write, your thoughts will flesh out]
[Writing is hard, but constant practice ]
[Contwxt model is x,y,z but it doesn't show this ]

House --> How does each room connect with each other?
        [Doors] 4 rooms only
        How do we measure if rooms do not fall apart?

What is system modeling?
System modeling of software = Blueprint of house
-->Blueprint contains all the abstract details of the house likewise system modeling
    is the abstract representation of the software.
-->Representing the system that is to be developed or existing one.
-->It helps to understand the requirements clearly.
-->This can be used for documentation

-->commonly used--UML--
	-->Activity
	-->usecase
	-->sequence
	-->class
	-->state

Architectural design
--> It describes how the system and its components should work.
ex : robot packing object
--what are the components in the systems
--how it is functioning?
--how it is communicating with other components.
*Stakeholder communication
*System analysis
*Reuse
--Block Diagram-- Commonly used so that people from different disciplines can understand the development process.

As a way of facilitating discussion about the system design
As a way of documenting an architecture that has been designed
