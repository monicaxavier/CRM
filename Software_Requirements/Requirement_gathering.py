System_requirements

Functional Requirements: How the system should interact and behave in different
situations. What the System is supposed to do.Eg: Functions of Toothbrush?
To Brush the Teeth.

Non-Functional Requirements: Constrains by the system.

This includes reliability, time, scalibility, peformance,
security. Sometimes, this is more important.Eg: What is Non-Functional
Requirement of Toothbrush? But Toothbrush breaks after you brush your teeth.
[Make sure we can quantitavely test out the Non-Functional Requirement]
[Ease of Use: Training Time, Number of Help Frames]

1) Requirements, Idea formulate -- Proposal,
Requirements -- System Requirements, Design, Architectural,
Software [Prototype], Implementation, Testing, Review.

Suppose you built a Church CRM.
Features -- Calender, SMS messaging, Contacts.
Okay you built it.
They want more features. But if you add more features, calnder won't work.
Will you redo all the code? Nope. Will you write 10,000 lines of code again?
Suppose afte you build a Church CRM. RMKV likes your product. Will you write 10,000
lines of code and create seperate product or you will reuse the code to make them also use
same product?

Always plan long-term, multiple industries, best practices within Software industry.
Reuse! maintainence.
In house there are windows.. different models. They'll just change.

Rick goes to A1-Parotta Stall. Rick orders Chilli Chicken and parrota.
Billing -> Abraham, He will give it to Master Parotta. He will have basic ingedients
for Chilli Chicken. Next, Muth goes to A-1 Parotta Stal. He asks for Butter Chicken.
Will Parotta Master have different ingredients for Butter Chicken or he would reuse the same receipie?
